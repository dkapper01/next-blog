Synchronous programming performs operations one after the other. A function must finish executing before it moves on to the next function. Some functions take longer than others to finish executing because they make requests to servers to fetch data. Sometimes this could be problematic because it can take a lot of time to execute the whole program. Programs are typically made up of both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

Asynchronous programming allows a program to move on to the other functions while previous functions finish executing. This way a program is allowed to handle multiple requests at the same time. Ultimately, decreasing the time it takes to finish executing the whole program.
